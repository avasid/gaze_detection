# gaze_detection
Predict direction of the gaze onscreen for multipurpose applications

This repository contains code for creating image data from video files, preprocessing image data, and training a ResNet architecture CNN for detecting where a user is looking onscreen from namely 4 directions(down, up, left, right).

Due to the lack of a rich generalised dataset, the architecture is not tested fully to its capacity, so the project requires major support in data as of now.

The project majorly relies on ```opencv``` and ```keras```. To install all the major requirements, run

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Project has been tested on ```Python3.6``` and ```Python3.7```.
